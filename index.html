        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            
          My name is Paul Kamau Wamaria.I am an aspiring and dedicated student at <a href="#">Moringa School</a>
           pursuing a prep course to
           become a <strong>Full stack web</strong><em> developer</em>. It has been my passion to work in a 
           computer related field and I have  a good feeling that I am on the right track. 
           Just imagine of school where you can learn at your own pace whith technical mentors that can help you anytime or wherever
           you are as long as long as you want to. That place is Moringa.

        <h2>A brief history about my background education</h2>

        <div class="column">
            <p >
            After my highschool education where I scored an A-minus, I joined Kenyatta University to pursue a degree in 
            <em>Computer science</em>. It was supposed to be an easy journey for me judging from my high school perfomance. However,
            the journey turned to be extremely difficult as I struggled with my finacial insecurities. I couldn't afford  a laptop 
            and felt like I was wasting my time learning theories. I decided to differ the semester and apply for a job.

            I got a job as an electrician where I couldn't give the best of myself be cause I felt like a part of me was missing. After
            working for quite a While, I bought a desktop and started coding. I had the basics of computer science but despite the fact, coding
            wasn't easy. I shifted my attention towards <span>graphic design</span> and found out that to be able to operate heavy graphic softwares 
            such as Autodesk maya, I needed some programming skills. I focussed my attention back to coding through online tutotrials
            until a friend of mine suggested that I should try <a href="#">Moringa School</a>

          <P>
            I applied for a prep course at Moringa  and got invited for an interview. You  can't imagine how happy I was when I received the 
            acceptance email. This is where I am currently learning to code:
