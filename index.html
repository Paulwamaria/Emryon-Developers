        <h2>A brief history about my background education</h2>

        <div class="column"
            <p >
            After my highschool education where I scored an A-minus, I joined Kenyatta University to pursue a degree in 
            <em>Computer science</em>. It was supposed to be an easy journey for me judging from my high school perfomance. However,
            the journey turned to be extremely difficult as I struggled with my finacial insecurities. I couldn't afford  a laptop 
            and felt like I was wasting my time learning theories. I decided to differ the semester and apply for a job.

            I got a job as an electrician where I couldn't give the best of myself be cause I felt like a part of me was missing. After
            working for quite a While, I bought a desktop and started coding. I had the basics of computer science but despite the fact, coding
            wasn't easy. I shifted my attention towards <span>graphic design</span> and found out that to be able to operate heavy graphic softwares 
            such as Autodesk maya, I needed some programming skills. I focussed my attention back to coding through online tutotrials
            until a friend of mine suggested that I should try <a href="#">Moringa School</a>
          </p>
