        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="pad">
            
          My name is Paul Kamau Wamaria.I am an aspiring and dedicated student at <a href="#">Moringa School</a>
           pursuing a prep course to
           become a <strong>Full stack web</strong><em> developer</em>. It has been my passion to work in a 
           computer related field and I have  a good feeling that I am on the right track. 
           Just imagine of school where you can learn at your own pace whith technical mentors that can help you anytime or wherever
           you are as long as long as you want to. That place is Moringa.

              <h2>Education background</h2>

            <p >
            After my highschool education where I scored an A-minus, I joined Kenyatta University to pursue a degree in 
            <em>Computer science</em>. It was supposed to be an easy journey for me judging from my high school perfomance. However,
            the journey turned to be extremely difficult as I struggled with my finacial insecurities. I couldn't afford  a laptop 
            and felt like I was wasting my time learning theories. I decided to differ the semester and apply for a job.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I got a job as an electrician where I couldn't give the best of myself be cause I felt like a part of me was missing. After
              working for quite a While, I bought a desktop and started coding. I had the basics of computer science but despite the fact, coding
              wasn't easy. I shifted my attention towards <span>graphic design</span> and found out that to be able to operate heavy graphic softwares 
              such as Autodesk maya, I needed some programming skills. I focussed my attention back to coding through online tutotrials
              until a friend of mine suggested that I should try <a href="#">Moringa School</a>

            <h2>Moringa school</h2>

            <P>
              I applied for a prep course at Moringa  and got invited for an interview. You  can't imagine how happy I was when I received the 
              acceptance email. This is where I am currently learning to code:

          <h4><a href ="https://github.com/Paulwamaria/myfirstWebpage.git">My first website</a></h4>

          <p>My first website is a simple webpage written with a little guidance from <em>Moringa</em> to practice with
          the most common elements of a basic html page. </p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/Paulwamaria/Mnazi-resort">Mnazi Island Resort </a></h4>

          <p>
            This is a webpage that is designed to portray a good image of an upcoming resort located on specific island. The website has a 
            home page that welcomes the viewer with a general view of the beautiful island. On the homepage there are links that points
            towards specific categories such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Accomodations</li>
              <li>Travel arrangements</li>

          <P>
            Coding is extremely exhausting, and therefore one is encouraged to identify atleast two ways of which they can decompress.
             Here is how I decompress.
          </P>
          <ol>
            <li>Exercising</li>
            <li>listening to music</li>
            <li>Reading inspirational novels</li>
            <li>watching horror movies</li>
            <li> Juggling</li>
