        <p class="pad">
            
          My name is <span>Paul Kamau Wamaria</span>.I am an aspiring and dedicated student at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>
           pursuing a prep course to
           become a <strong>Full stack web</strong><em> developer</em>. It has been my passion to work in a 
           computer related field and I have  a good feeling that I am on the right track. 
           Just imagine of a school where you can learn at your own pace whith technical mentors who are willing to help you anytime or wherever
           you are as long as you want to. That place is Moringa.

            <p >
              After  dropping out of kenyatta university for not being able to afford a laptop, I got a job that I never liked  and 
              it drained all my energy. I bought a desktop and started self teaching coding but it was overwhelming.
               I shifted my attention towards <span>graphic design</span> and found out that to be able to operate heavy graphic softwares 
              such as Autodesk maya, I needed some programming skills. I focussed my attention back to coding through online tutotrials
              until a friend of mine suggested that I should try <a href="#">Moringa School</a>. Follow this <a href ="back-education.html">link</a> to learn more about my <a href="back-education.html">education background</a>

            <P>
              I applied for a prep course at Moringa  and got invited for an interview. You  can't imagine how happy I was when I received the 
              acceptance email. This is where I am currently learning to code:

          <p>Through the help of Moringa Tecnical mentors and their wornderful Learning management system, here are some
              of the Websites that I have created. </p>

          <h4><a href ="https://github.com/Paulwamaria/myfirstWebpage.git">My first website</a></h4>

          <p>My first website is a simple webpage written with a little guidance from <em>Moringa</em> to practice with
          the most common elements of a basic html page. </p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/Paulwamaria/Mnazi-resort">Mnazi Island Resort </a></h4>

          <P>
            Coding is extremely exhausting, and therefore one is encouraged to identify atleast two ways of which they can decompress.
             Here is how I decompress. <i><a href="hobbies.html">More</a> about <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a></i> .
