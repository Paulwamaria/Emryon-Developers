      <h2>Education background</h2>

      <p >
      After my highschool education, I joined Kenyatta University to pursue a degree in 
      <em>Computer science</em>. It was supposed to be an easy journey for me judging from my high school perfomance. However,
      the journey turned out to be extremely difficult as I struggled with my finacial insecurities. I couldn't afford  a laptop 
      and felt like I was wasting my time learning theories. I decided to differ the semester and apply for a job.

        I got a job as an electrician where I couldn't give the best of myself because I felt like a part of me was missing. After
        working for quite a While, I bought a desktop and started coding. I had the basics of computer science but despite the fact, coding
        wasn't easy. I shifted my attention towards <span>graphic design</span> and found out that to be able to operate heavy graphic softwares 
        such as Autodesk maya, I needed some programming skills. I focussed my attention back to coding through online tutotrials
        until a friend of mine suggested that I should try <a href="#">Moringa School</a>
