            <p>
              Well, the good thing about Motion graphics is that the only limit to what we can achieve is the level of imagination.

            <h1>lets talk about mental health</h1>
            <h3>mental health</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                But what is mental health? What exactly is being normal? Well most people believe that being normal is not wearing tattered clothes while walking along the streets collecting papers. I believe being normal is being at equilibrium between your inner and your outer self, it is like that point where your blood pressure balances with the atmospheric pressure, it’s the middle of the swing of a pendulum. Its when you know who you are. It's also when you know that your selfworth does not depend on your accomplishements or other people's approval.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Mental health</strong> is the pattern of one's thinking, functioning and behavior. This pattern could appear abnormal in which case we presume that the subject has at least one of the mental health disorders. It is a sensitive issue that the society is not well aware of and may lead to suicidal depression and probably early death. It has already claimed lives of many who could be alive today had they opened up to people who understand. The next victim could be your relative, or you friend and this is why we need to create mental health awareness. We all should be ready when depression strikes.</p>
            <p>Mental health is a difficult subject to comprehend because one could be a picture perfect on the outside but deep within, they are mess, or a house of cards just one blow away from caving in. This is why sometimes we hear these kinds of statements on interviews pertaining suicide issues: <i>“she was so happy and full of joy, I just can’t understand why she took her own life…I simply didn’t see it coming.”</i> My point is, sometimes even the victims themselves will not know that they are emotionally compromised. Well, sometimes it will be obvious but other times it will require a keen study on the behavioral change on a person’s life. These are some of the ways that one can tell that they are mentally disturbed:-
              </p>
            <h3>General signs and symptoms of mental illness.</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Neurosis</li>
              <li>Loss of interest and pleasure in activities previously enjoyed.</li>
              <li>Feeling of worthlessness or guilt.</li>
              <li>Feeling sadness</li>
              <li>Lack of energy and the feeling of fatigue</li>
              <li>Suicidal thoughts.</li>
              <li>Difficulties in thinking,impulsive and indesicive.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            When we talk about mental illness, its depression that comes in mind, but what we need to understand is that depression can mask itself in form of other disorders such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders or substance abuse disorders.
            </p>
            
              <h3>Depression</h3>
              <p>
  It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and is an emotional condition characterized by the feeling of low self-worth, guilt and inability to enjoy life as it unfolds. Watch out for the religious fanatics who think depression is demon possession and will even go to the extent of trying exorcism. This will only worsen the situation.

            </p>
            <h3>Causes of depression</h3>
            <p>The real cause of depression is unknown but there are risk factors that may lead to depression.</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>personality</dt>
              <dd>It is obvious that pessimistic people, cynical people and people who have low self esteem have a higher chance of falling into depression. These are simply people who can't handle stress.</dd>
              <dt>Environment</dt>
              <dd>
                Destructive criticism, Abuse,violence and sometimes extreme poverty may lead depression.
              </dd>
              <dt>Genetics</dt>
              <dd>
                Sometimes it just runs in the family.
              </dd>
              <dt>Biochemistry</dt>
              <dd>
                Sometimes the brain just malfunctions resulting to chemical imbalance that inturn lead to depression.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              <i>How can we treat depression?</i> Well the good thing about depression is that its treatable. The victim may use medication by taking anti depressants or psychotherapy. The later is ussually the best mode of treatment as it involves assessing the problem from the root. This method is sometimes referred to as the <strong><q>bacterial approach</q></strong>; We treat the bacteria rather than the symptom. However, therapy only works if the victim is willing to cooporate. Sometimes the victims may fail to share their problems especially if the depression is accompanied by <i>social anxiety disorder</i>. In such scenarios, its only the victims that can help themselves. All we can do is point them towards self-help books and hope that they'll take the initiative to transform their live.  As a matter of fact, the best therapy is when you make the victim understand that healing comes from within. Let us take the initiative and create mental health awareness. Let us be our neighbours watch and intervene when there is a problem. May we never come to say that we did not see that coming.
